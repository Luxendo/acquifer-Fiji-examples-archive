# Fiji-scripting with the ACQUIFER tools
Example macros (.ijm) and jython scripts (.py) demonstrating useful functions provided by the [ACQUIFER update site](https://www.acquifer.de/resources/acquifer-fiji-utilities/) in Fiji (freely available upon [request](https://www.acquifer.de/resources/acquifer-fiji-utilities/activate-update-site/)), or more generally by the [ACQUIFER java packages](https://www.acquifer.de/resources/acquifer-java-packages/).  
Some of these examples are also shipped by the update site, and are available in the menu *Acquifer > Examples*.  

The examples can be opened and run in Fiji, by drag and dropping the script file on the Fiji window.  
Currently for the ImageJ macro-language, the examples cover the extraction of metadata from the image file name (see *examples > MetadataParsing*).  

The jython scripts demonstrate a larger panel of functions available in the Java API, which can be reproduced in other scripting languages supported by Fiji.  
For the scripting examples, some functions are specifically available for Fiji (ex: hyperstack), while others such as metadata parsing are not depending on Fiji and thus could be used in other java software such as QuPath or ICY.
