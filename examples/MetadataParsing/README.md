This scripts demonstrates how to parse metadata from image filenames using either the macro-language (.ijm files) or a scripting language such as jython (ie using the acquifer java API).  
The script can be run by drag and dropping on Fiji's window and clicking run.  

Parsing functionalities are provided for the latest Imaging Machine version (IM04), but also for the previous version (IM03).    
IM03 filenames start with "WE***", IM04 filenames start with a dash "-"
